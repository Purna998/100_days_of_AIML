# Additional: 
    # Extend the project by exploring addtional relationships(e.g. day of the week vs tip amount)
    # Perform multiple linear regression with addtional variables (e.g include smoking status)
    # Use another real-world dataset(e.g. healthcare or sales data) to apply similar techniques
